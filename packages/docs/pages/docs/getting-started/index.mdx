### Wrap your app with the ThemeProvider component

Some components can be standalone, but to make sure that components work
correctly, we recommend you to wrap your entire app with the 
[ThemeProvider](/core/theme-provider) component. This allows the components 
styling be consistent across your entire application

<Preview>
  <CodeHighlight>
    ```vue
    ./src/app.vue

    <script setup lang="ts">
      import { ThemeProvider } from '@vue-material/core'
    </script>

    <template>
      <ThemeProvider :options="{ <layout options> }">
        <!--
          My Application
        -->
      </ThemeProvider>
    </template>
    ```

  </CodeHighlight>
</Preview>

You can configure the theme of your application via the `options` prop.
Check of [ThemeProvider Docs](/core/theme-provider#props) for available options
